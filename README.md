<p> Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The survival rate for people with CNS tumor is approximately 35 percent.
Brain Tumors are classified as Benign, Malignant or Pituitary. Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of 
knowledge about tumors makes it challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRI. We want to help healthcare workers in diagnosing and treating the patients. </p>
